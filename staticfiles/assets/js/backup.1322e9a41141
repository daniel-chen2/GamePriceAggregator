70	A Story About My Uncle	A Story About My Uncle is a first-person adventure with a heavy focus on moving using a grappling hook and a non-violent approach thus making the plot and landscapes the critical focus of the gaming experience. There is no series of this game: it is the only title in the IP by Gone North also known as Goat Simulator creators. \nThe core gameplay features are the energetic costume giving its owner the ability to jump higher and use the grappling hook, and various updates to this outfit, for example, jetpack boots. While mastering this Spider-Man-like potential, the hero encounters various non-hostile NPCs and environment, the only menacing obstacle in the game is a one-eyed worm, lurking in one of the caves. However, the worst scenario is that it blows you off the cliff. Worm likes to take a nap so getting over him is not a big deal.\nThe plot follows a boy looking for his uncle, Freud.

71	Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus	Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus is a singleplayer FPS developed by MachineGames. It is the third installment in the rebooted series.\nSet in the alternate 1961 where Nazi Germany won World War II, the game picks up right at the end of Wolfenstein: The New Order.

Blaskowicz falls unconscious for 5 months and is woken up by a Nazi attack. The player has to repel the attack and end the Nazi reign over America once and for all.\nThe New Colossus features several stealth-action elements, just like the previous title in the series.

The Protagonist doesn&#39;t stick to cover, leaning out of it instead.\nThe game offers a linear storyline, but the player is free to complete side-missions in any order they like. Completing these missions is rewarded with new weapon upgrades.	2017-10-27		[{"platform": {"id": 4, "name": "PC", "slug": "pc"}}, {"platform": {"id": 1, "name": "Xbox One", "slug": "xbox-one"}}, {"platform": {"id": 18, "name": "PlayStation 4", "slug": "playstation4"}}, {"platform": {"id": 7, "name": "Nintendo Switch", "slug": "nintendo-switch"}}]	28202	https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a0e/a0ef08621301a1eab5e04fa5c96978fa.jpeg	\N

The game features 7 playable classes, from a mere footsoldier to the tank commander. The playable maps include up to 64 players and feature different game modes. Red Orchestra 2 emphasizes on the difficulty of battles and maximum realism, making it one of the few “hardcore” WW2 shooters.\nThe Rising Storm expansion focuses on the Pacific front, adding two new factions with varying equipment and battlefield capabilities, and new maps to play on.

73	Darksiders II	Darksiders II is a third person slasher/RPG, the second installment in the Darksiders series. The game shares many similarities with its predecessor, but also exhibits new features such as an open world, overhauled quest system and dialogues.\nThe main character is the second Rider of Apocalypse, Death, out on a quest to support previous game’s protagonist, War, and to restore what has been lost by the world. The key features of the series, the extensive combat system, and various riddles have also seen significant improvements. RPG elements exist in the form of leveling up your protagonist and acquiring new skills for both combat and battle support. The game also features an immersive soundtrack, which will accompany the players throughout every location and battle.\nDarksiders II has implemented many traits common to third-person RPGs of the time, but it still manages to be outstanding with its unique design of locations and enemies, a more realistic combat system and other overhauls of the game mechanics, all resulting in a refined experience for any player.	2012-08-14		[{"platform": {"id": 4, "name": "PC", "slug": "pc"}}, {"platform": {"id": 14, "name": "Xbox 360", "slug": "xbox360"}}, {"platform": {"id": 16, "name": "PlayStation 3", "slug": "playstation3"}}, {"platform": {"id": 10, "name": "Wii U", "slug": "wii-u"}}]	4179	https://media.rawg.io/media/games/848/8482235332f4518da363c3cb4e5cd075.jpg	\N
74	XCOM 2	The game continues the previous game line: XCOM Enemy Unknown. In XCOM 2 we see the Earth under the rule of aliens. The order established by them is based on total control but is proclaimed as the realm of prosperity and security. However, on the periphery of large cities, there are those who consider it a dictatorship and are struggling to restore independence to people. Thus the new XCOM, the organisation of freedom fighters, is reborn. The base for the organisation&#39;s soldiers is now the alien ship &quot;The Avenger&quot;, converted to the needs of the defenders of the Earth.\nThe player will have to travel around the global map, contact guerrillas in various places, look for resources and perform partisan attacks on the critical points of the enemies. The tactics of the organisation have changed - now they are in the minority. The factories for the production of weapons and other equipment were closed 20 years ago, so you have to collect any found equipment and resources.\nThe game introduced many new enemies, but there are aliens from the previous game too. The hero of the game has a unique ability to be in contact with the psi-network uniting all the aliens. This ability makes him a turning point in which the enslavement of the Earth can be reversed.	2016-02-04		[{"platform": {"id": 4, "name": "PC", "slug": "pc"}}, {"platform": {"id": 18, "name": "PlayStation 4", "slug": "playstation4"}}, {"platform": {"id": 5, "name": "macOS", "slug": "macos"}}, {"platform": {"id": 6, "name": "Linux", "slug": "linux"}}]	1256	https://media.rawg.io/media/games/9bf/9bfac18ff678f41a4674250fa0e04a52.jpg	\N
75	Mark of the Ninja	Mark of the ninja is a side-scrolling stealth-action. The game follows an unnamed ninja who is tasked to revenge a private military company that attacked ninja’s clan dojo.  \nThe gameplay can be described as a mix of 2D platformer and stealth-action.

77	Alien: Isolation	Alien: Isolation is an action-survival horror game played from the first-person perspective for a more intense experience. The game is not a sequel to any of Alien games, but it is directly connected to the original 1979 Alien film, so the gameplay includes historical references, and the game itself transfers the unique atmosphere and the old vision of the future. The action is set 15 years after the film events. Young Amanda Ripley accompanied by Nina Taylor and the android Christopher Samuels reaches a distant space station Sevastopol to investigate the case of her mother Ellen Ripley (the protagonist of the 1979 film) disappearance. On the way to the Nostromo’s (Ellen’s spacecraft) flight recorder, Amanda will face plenty of hardships like hostile androids and Aliens because the Sevastopol station is wholly abandoned. Players have to explore the entire station inhabited with Aliens. Due to the crafting system, players can create the necessary gear to prevent contacts with countless enemies.	2014-10-06		[{"platform": {"id": 4, "name": "PC", "slug": "pc"}}, {"platform": {"id": 1, "name": "Xbox One", "slug": "xbox-one"}}, {"platform": {"id": 18, "name": "PlayStation 4", "slug": "playstation4"}}, {"platform": {"id": 7, "name": "Nintendo Switch", "slug": "nintendo-switch"}}]	3556	https://media.rawg.io/media/games/daa/daaee07fcb40744d90cf8142f94a241f.jpg	\N

It further continues the series after Assassin&#39;s Creed Syndicate.\nThe story is set in two time periods simultaneously.

Players can use Senu to scout the area ahead and highlight enemies.\nThe game features a heavily revised combat system that relies on hit-box mechanics rather than pre-determined animations as it did in the previous titles. Origins focuses on introducing various types of enemies that the players will have to learn about in order to defeat them.	2017-10-27		[{"platform": {"id": 4, "name": "PC", "slug": "pc"}}, {"platform": {"id": 1, "name": "Xbox One", "slug": "xbox-one"}}, {"platform": {"id": 18, "name": "PlayStation 4", "slug": "playstation4"}}]	28153	https://media.rawg.io/media/games/336/336c6bd63d83cf8e59937ab8895d1240.jpg	\N
79	Far Cry 4	Far Cry 4 is a first-person shooter, which inherits traditions of the original Far Cry franchise. However, the plot of the fourth chapter is unique and has no direct references to the previous games of the series. The story is now set in the Far East, where the new main character Ajay Gale joins the opposition fighting the dictatorship. The open world lets players explore the entire environment of Kyrat – a tiny fictional region hidden in towering Himalayas. Ajay as a Kyrati-American travels to Kyrat to scatter the ashes of his mother in her motherland, but suddenly things go the wrong way, and he finds himself in the middle of the civil war between the powerful dictator Pagan Min and rebels from the Golden Path founded by his father. As the story progresses, players get new weaponry and equipment or customize the ones they have. From the very beginning, the whole map is not available, so to progress and to complete the story players have to open all the game areas by “activating” bell towers (traditional Far Cry mechanic) for establishing the Golden Path’s radio propaganda and defeating enemies’ fortresses.	2014-11-18		[{"platform": {"id": 4, "name": "PC", "slug": "pc"}}, {"platform": {"id": 1, "name": "Xbox One", "slug": "xbox-one"}}, {"platform": {"id": 18, "name": "PlayStation 4", "slug": "playstation4"}}, {"platform": {"id": 14, "name": "Xbox 360", "slug": "xbox360"}}, {"platform": {"id": 16, "name": "PlayStation 3", "slug": "playstation3"}}]	3497	https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d00/d007f20fdafb5f5820389f85b78fdc6d.jpg	\N
80	Papers, Please	The creator of the game often travelled through Asia and made the observation that the work of an immigration officer checking documents for entry is simultaneously very monotonous and very responsible. The game reproduces this work - but scammers and unusual situations occur in it much more often than in reality. The task of the player-officer is not to make a mistake, not to let an unwanted guest into the country. He has power, directories, translucent devices, etc., but experienced masters of deception and fraud act against him.

And the significant thing now that there is no driving on the rails, sudden acceleration of rivals and unpunished wiping of bumpers (also, damage to the machine is not displayed on the screen, it is necessary to focus on its behaviour and the replica of racing engineer).\nThe main feature of GRID is time rewinding. The number of rewinds is limited, but with this, you can save yourself from a fatal outcome.	2013-05-27		[{"platform": {"id": 4, "name": "PC", "slug": "pc"}}, {"platform": {"id": 5, "name": "macOS", "slug": "macos"}}, {"platform": {"id": 14, "name": "Xbox 360", "slug": "xbox360"}}, {"platform": {"id": 16, "name": "PlayStation 3", "slug": "playstation3"}}]	4003	https://media.rawg.io/media/games/27b/27b02ffaab6b250cc31bf43baca1fc34.jpg	\N

Also, you have to keep your mental health all right and don&#39;t go completely mad at a situation, when these dreadful and twisted creatures are running towards you to tear apart. It seems like the world of Don&#39;t Starve is heavily inspired by Tim Burton, having a very grotesque yet creepy and bizarre-looking monsters and locations with an atmospheric soundtrack.\nWhile heading to multiplayer, you will experience every single problem from a singles game. The game exploits pretty similar mechanic to Minecraft - randomly generated world, surviving as a top priority for the gamer. With the only difference - if you die, you die. Permanent death of your characters increases the grim and tense atmosphere of the game itself, making the process challenging and creepy. Just remember.

You play as Corvo Attano, Empress&#39; bodyguard, a masterful assassin and a combat specialist. All of a sudden, a group of assassins kill the Empress and kidnaps her daughter Emily.

You can spare the lives of your enemies by knocking them out or making others do the job for you or brutally murder everyone in the city. Gadgets are given by Piero Joplin, Loyalists engineer and by the Outsider, who gives Corvo magical abilities. The game reacts to your choices - grim atmosphere by itself can be turned even darker by killing people or slightly lighter by not doing so.

182	Just Cause 3	Just Cause 3 is an open-world action adventure with the large locus on freedom of exploring. It is the thirds title in the Just Cause series produced by Avalanche Studios, preceded by the first two numerical parts and having the 4th part not yet released as its successor.\nRico Rodriguez is the protagonist of the game, who is continually being forced to deal with bandits and dictators somewhere in the Mediterranean. The events of the third game in the series take place 6 years after the second installment. \nAny game of this category is strongly associated with complete freedom of roaming, and the third part pushes all the metrics up: you now have 1 000 square kilometers of space to wander around and upgraded hook which has allowed you continuously to overcome any obstacle. The grappling hook works like a universal tool: you may drag your enemies closer Skorpion-style, climb mountains and cling to foe&#39;s cars. \nNot only tools but physics provide unique exploring experience — the key word for them is an exaggeration for any event in the game looks like it was cut straight out of an action movie.	2015-11-30		[{"platform": {"id": 4, "name": "PC", "slug": "pc"}}, {"platform": {"id": 1, "name": "Xbox One", "slug": "xbox-one"}}, {"platform": {"id": 18, "name": "PlayStation 4", "slug": "playstation4"}}]	3017	https://media.rawg.io/media/games/5bb/5bb55ccb8205aadbb6a144cf6d8963f1.jpg	\N

After fighting a demon called Straga, he is summoned by the council. It accuses him of destroying the balance, and that now the Apocalypse is unstoppable. Convincing the council in his innocence, War now has to stop the Endwar.\nDarksiders is a typical hack-and-slash game that lets you produce comboes with two primary weapons - Chaoseater and Scythe - and various gadgets. While defeating his enemies, War can execute them with brutality. The gameplay is undertoned with dark mythology bound with the present days.	2010-01-27		[{"platform": {"id": 4, "name": "PC", "slug": "pc"}}, {"platform": {"id": 14, "name": "Xbox 360", "slug": "xbox360"}}, {"platform": {"id": 16, "name": "PlayStation 3", "slug": "playstation3"}}]	4502	https://media.rawg.io/media/games/8d4/8d46786ca86b1d95f3dc7e700e2dc4dd.jpg	\N

185	Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons	Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a story about teamwork. Having a very curious setup, the story follows two brothers on a quest. With their mother dead and father being heavily ill, the only way to save is to bring water from the Tree of Life. But on their way, they will have to challenge the world and themselves. Villages, mountains and forests, bullies, trolls and wolves will await Naiee and Naia on their journey. \nWith having such setup, the game found a perfect way to portray this world to the audience. The beautiful visual style and something in between adventure and a platformer make the game an exciting experience. Although that is not the most curious thing about the game. With having two brothers involved in a story, the game actually gives you an opportunity to control both of them. You can solve puzzles by simultaneously moving both of the characters. For example, one of your heroes must distract an enemy, and another is supposed to go behind. This amazing feature provides you with one of the most unique experiences as you play two characters at once.	2013-08-07		[{"platform": {"id": 4, "name": "PC", "slug": "pc"}}, {"platform": {"id": 18, "name": "PlayStation 4", "slug": "playstation4"}}, {"platform": {"id": 1, "name": "Xbox One", "slug": "xbox-one"}}, {"platform": {"id": 3, "name": "iOS", "slug": "ios"}}, {"platform": {"id": 21, "name": "Android", "slug": "android"}}, {"platform": {"id": 7, "name": "Nintendo Switch", "slug": "nintendo-switch"}}, {"platform": {"id": 14, "name": "Xbox 360", "slug": "xbox360"}}, {"platform": {"id": 16, "name": "PlayStation 3", "slug": "playstation3"}}]	18240	https://media.rawg.io/media/games/b6b/b6b20bfc4b34e312dbc8aac53c95a348.jpg	\N

The people on the sidewalks, the stylish cars and neon light clubs, the sky-high buildings and lively piers and beaches, everything will bring nostalgic feelings to those of players, whose eyes have seen the glory of this time. The gameplay, however, bears little difference from its predecessor, continuing the trend of big guns, explosions, and cop chases.	2002-10-27		[{"platform": {"id": 4, "name": "PC", "slug": "pc"}}, {"platform": {"id": 18, "name": "PlayStation 4", "slug": "playstation4"}}, {"platform": {"id": 3, "name": "iOS", "slug": "ios"}}, {"platform": {"id": 21, "name": "Android", "slug": "android"}}, {"platform": {"id": 5, "name": "macOS", "slug": "macos"}}, {"platform": {"id": 80, "name": "Xbox", "slug": "xbox-old"}}, {"platform": {"id": 16, "name": "PlayStation 3", "slug": "playstation3"}}, {"platform": {"id": 15, "name": "PlayStation 2", "slug": "playstation2"}}]	430	https://media.rawg.io/media/games/13a/13a528ac9cf48bbb6be5d35fe029336d.jpg	\N

Choosing from three different styles, you can adapt Geralt for any kind of a combat situation. Fast style of fighting gives you an opportunity to strike your opponents with your speed. The strong style focuses itself on destroying your enemies with powerful attacks, while sweeping style is very good when facing a number of foes.

The game never gives a precise definition of evil, which leads the player to convenient situations where the choice is quite bad anyway.

And now, after a run-in with the corrupt police forces, when they’re in the hands of the Syndicate, alone and cut out from the gathered wealth and support, 3rd Street Saints have to start from the bottom. \nWhile being a third person action adventure game, Saints Row: the Third is described by developers as the game that has everything in it.

231	Half-Life 2: Deathmatch	Upon the release of Half-Life 2 players were greatly disappointed in one thing, and that’s the lack of multiplayer. Granted, single-player campaign of Half-Life 2 was impressive, but weapons that have been demonstrated in it made players curious. They questioned if the experience was complete because the first Half-Life included multiplayer mode from the beginning. Valve took the criticism and published Half-Life 2: Deathmatch – multiplayer only addition, based on the main game, which was a separate product, distributed on Steam. \nThe game includes two major modes, which are Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. Both modes have similar rules. Players must kill as many other players as possible, to gain points. Player or team with the most points win, and points are retracted for self-killing and team killing.

255	Half-Life 2	Gordon Freeman became the most popular nameless and voiceless protagonist in gaming history. He is painted as the most famous scientist and a hero within the world of Half-Life, and for a good reason.

And you, as a player, will help this world to survive. This time Gordon arrives in City 17, ravaged and occupied by Combines, where he meets his old Black Mesa friends. \nWhat is different, aside from the overall design quality, is the use of Valve’s Source engine that not only expands on the fluidity of character model animations and movement but allows players to interact with a myriad of objects with the advanced and realistic (to an extent) physics. Classic Headcrab Zombies are revamped and have new variants that provide players with different threats. For a story-driven FPS, Half-Life 2 is unique in its plot delivery, and making in-game mechanics feel natural, be it platforming or driving.	2004-11-16		[{"platform": {"id": 4, "name": "PC", "slug": "pc"}}, {"platform": {"id": 21, "name": "Android", "slug": "android"}}, {"platform": {"id": 5, "name": "macOS", "slug": "macos"}}, {"platform": {"id": 6, "name": "Linux", "slug": "linux"}}, {"platform": {"id": 14, "name": "Xbox 360", "slug": "xbox360"}}, {"platform": {"id": 80, "name": "Xbox", "slug": "xbox-old"}}]	13537	https://media.rawg.io/media/games/b8c/b8c243eaa0fbac8115e0cdccac3f91dc.jpg	\N
256	Tomb Raider (2013)	A cinematic revival of the series in its action third person form, Tomb Rider follows Lara in her least experience period of life – her youth.

But shipwreck postponed the successful arrival and seemingly forgotten island is heavily populated with hostile inhabitants, cultists of Solarii Brotherhood.\nThe game will be graphic at times, especially after failed QTE’s during some of the survival scenes, but overall players will enjoy classic action adventure, reminiscent of the beginning of the series.

257	Limbo	This popular 2D puzzle-platformer creates the atmosphere of isolation, where the player alone can guide the nameless protagonist to his destination. Hostile environments and one-hit deaths may seem difficult, but the game implements a fair amount of checkpoints. The monochrome color palette showcases cartoony proportions of every living thing while making lack of details threatening. Limbo shows you exactly what you encounter, but never how it looks.\nLimbo uses the atmosphere and sound design of the horror genre while avoiding tropes of the modern horror games. The overarching theme and unique style compensated for the rather short game with an abrupt ending, making Limbo one of the most impactful games for the genre.\nThe simple controls and easy-to-pick-up mechanics help to make a clear distinction, which part of the stage players can interact with, and which part can lead to the quick death. Even though the game is in black and white, this separation is intuitive and natural, so the player would know exactly where to go or what to do.	2010-07-21		[{"platform": {"id": 4, "name": "PC", "slug": "pc"}}, {"platform": {"id": 18, "name": "PlayStation 4", "slug": "playstation4"}}, {"platform": {"id": 1, "name": "Xbox One", "slug": "xbox-one"}}, {"platform": {"id": 3, "name": "iOS", "slug": "ios"}}, {"platform": {"id": 21, "name": "Android", "slug": "android"}}, {"platform": {"id": 5, "name": "macOS", "slug": "macos"}}, {"platform": {"id": 6, "name": "Linux", "slug": "linux"}}, {"platform": {"id": 7, "name": "Nintendo Switch", "slug": "nintendo-switch"}}, {"platform": {"id": 14, "name": "Xbox 360", "slug": "xbox360"}}, {"platform": {"id": 16, "name": "PlayStation 3", "slug": "playstation3"}}, {"platform": {"id": 19, "name": "PS Vita", "slug": "ps-vita"}}]	1030	https://media.rawg.io/media/games/929/9295e55ce69cf5337c567983cf8b4137.jpeg	\N
