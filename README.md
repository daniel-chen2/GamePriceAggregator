# GamePriceAggregator (2020 Project)
Project is currently live at: https://thebargaingamer.herokuapp.com/

Project Brief:
A web scraper app that aggregates prices from a number of different australian gaming stores and displays it into a web frontend where users can search and compare these prices.

This is a project I had created in the early part of 2020 that I had intended to host live. 
I found it again after 1-2 years of working professionally and although its far from perfect I still think it was a cool little project to stumble across. 

Looking back the code was not super clean, poorly documented with no unit testing and could have been architected more suitably for the demands of the project.
